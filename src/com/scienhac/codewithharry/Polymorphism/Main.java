/*
✅ Polymorphism = many forms

In Java, there are two types:

1️⃣ Compile-time polymorphism

Method overloading

Operator overloading (not in Java except + for String)

2️⃣ Runtime polymorphism

Method overriding (MOST IMPORTANT)

Dynamic dispatch --> here it is like Animal a = new Dog(); when we call a.sound() it will call Dog's sound method not Animal's sound method

Virtual method calls --> here like code example is Animal a = new Dog(); a.sound(); here the method to be called is determined at runtime not compile time
